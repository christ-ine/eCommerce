## User Story
AS an online shop owner
I WANT a fully-functional website
SO THAT users can purchase my products
AND I can manage my inventory, users, and orders

## Usage 

The user is presented with the home page where they can browse through products, read reviews, and add products to their cart. When the user is ready to purchase, they will be prompted to register. Once the user has created an account they can login and proceed with their order. They will be prompted to enter their shipping information and payment prefernce. From there they will be taken to the payment page where their order summary will be presented to them and they will be able to pay through paypal or debit or credit, and a payment confirmation will be presented to them. Users also have the option to go to their pofile and edit their info as well as view their orders and check if they have been delivered. Users can later leave a rating and a review of the products they've purchased. 

Admins of the application have the ability to add, delete, and update products. They can also manage users and orders. When an order has been fulfilled and the customer has paid, the admin will have the ability to mark an order as 'out for delivery' to update the customer.
